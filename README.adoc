# my-zip

## What it does?

App zips two sequences even if they are of different length. Remaining elements are added to the end of a new sequence.

## Dependencies

It is a Scala program created in Intellij Idea project.

GitHub workflow created via https://diamantidis.github.io/2020/05/17/ci-with-github-actions-for-scala-project. 

scalaVersion := "2.13.8"

## How to run

1. Import myZip object. OR Add extends App to the myZip project `object myZip extends App {...}`.
2. Use myzip method on two sequences of any type. For example `myzip(Seq(1, 2, 3), Seq('a', 'a', 'a'))`.

## Troubleshooting

Using myzip method with a first sequence which contains `CHARS` converts them to `INT`.

* myzip()

** Seq(1, 'a', 2, 'a', 3, 'a')
-- Seq(1, 2, 3)
-- Seq('a', 'a', 'a')
