# my-zip

## What it does?

App zips two sequences even if they are of different length. Remaining elements are added to the end of a new sequence.

## Dependencies

It is a Scala program created in Intellij Idea project.

GitHub workflow created via https://diamantidis.github.io/2020/05/17/ci-with-github-actions-for-scala-project. 

Tests created with : 
`libraryDependencies += "org.scalactic" %% "scalactic" % "3.2.12"`

`libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.2.12" % "test"`

`libraryDependencies += "org.scalacheck" %% "scalacheck" % "1.16.0" % "test"`

`libraryDependencies += "org.scalatestplus" %% "scalacheck-1-16" % "3.2.12.0" % "test"`

## How to run

1. Import myZip object. OR Add extends App to the myZip project `object myZip extends App {...}`
2. Use myzip method on two sequences of any type. For example `myzip(Seq(1, 2, 3), Seq('a', 'a', 'a'))`

## Troubleshooting

Using myzip method with a first sequence which contains `CHARS` converts them to `INT`.
